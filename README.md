# weatherApp

This is an application that displays local weather, and your area name. It also provides you with cute messages and friendly reminders! I made this using javascript, React Native, and Expo. Used one external API from OpenWeatherMap.You can find this application in Google Play store. If you want to try it out, follow this [link]!
